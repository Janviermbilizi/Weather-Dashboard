I used HTML, CSS, Javascript, jquery and bootstrap library and of course Git/Github were used as version control. Weather API were also used.

<strong>Installation</strong>

This is only a website and does not need installation. it is currently hosted in github and you can access it at https://janviermbilizi.github.io/Weather-Dashboard/

<strong>Usage</strong>

The page is simple, clean, easy to use and undertand. When you go to the site, an input erea will be provided on the left side of the page. You will enter the City then click <i>Search</i> button. Once clicked, the weather information will appear on the right side. The top will be the weather of that day and below will be the weather of the following 5 Days / 5 Day forecast. Below the search button, the most recent cities that you searched for, will appear and will be stored locally in your browser using local Storage.
